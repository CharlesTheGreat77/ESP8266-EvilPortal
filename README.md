# Captive Portal Example

# Note 
Upon initial connect to the AP opens a captive portal that states "No HTML tempate uploaded", 
when inputing an html template from online, it will update the captive portal automatically.
I did not want to hardcode different templates for each portal.. why not just copy and paste 
existing portals!!! ü§îüìù
