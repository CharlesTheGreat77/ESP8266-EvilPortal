# Download INO
Download and flash the INO file and look for ESP8266AP as a softAP

# Setup
To access the web interface, go to http://192.168.4.1/admin in your favorite web browser.
Web interface username and password is admin:admin

# Note 
Upon initial connect to the AP opens a captive portal that states "No HTML tempate uploaded", 
when inputing an html template from online, it will update the captive portal automatically.
I did not want to hardcode different templates for each portal.. why not just copy and paste 
existing portals!!! ü§îüìù
